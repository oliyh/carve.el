;; (carve)

;; todo
;; - check for existence of src / test and use them if present
;; - find project root to execute from (projectile? or something else?)
;; - carve-current-file: set carve path to current file

;; - commands could be carve-current-file, carve-project
;; - keyboard shortcuts, example at least
;; - key to add line to ignore file

;; - in result buffer, could have a key which will delete the form it refers to?

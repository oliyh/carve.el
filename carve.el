;; Command to run carve

;;; Code:
(defgroup carve nil
  "Settings for carve"
  :group 'tools)

(defcustom carve-command "carve"
  "*The carve command to run"
  :type 'string
  :group 'carve)

(defun carve ()
  (let ((buf (get-buffer-create "*carve-output*"))
        (inhibit-read-only t))
    (with-current-buffer buf
      (erase-buffer)
      ;; (read-only-mode t)
      (select-window (display-buffer buf))
      (let ((process (start-file-process "carve" buf carve-command "--opts" "{:paths [\"src\" \"test\"] :report {:format :text}}")))
        (while (accept-process-output process)))
      (goto-char (point-min))
)))

;; doesn't work
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-c") 'carve)

;; (carve)


;; todo
;; - erase-buffer doesn't work
;; - check for existence of .carve config in project, and use that?
;; - set carve path to current file if it's clj/c/s (or clojure mode is on?)

;; - commands could be carve-current-file, carve-project
;; - keyboard shortcuts, example at least

;; - in result buffer, pressing enter visits the file / line / char
;; - in result buffer, could have a key which will delete the form it refers to?


;; (carve)
;;; carve.el ends here

;; (carve)

;; todo
;; - check for existence of .carve config in project, and use that?
;; - set carve path to current file if it's clj/c/s (or clojure mode is on?)

;; - commands could be carve-current-file, carve-project
;; - keyboard shortcuts, example at least

;; - in result buffer, pressing enter visits the file / line / char
;; - in result buffer, could have a key which will delete the form it refers to?
